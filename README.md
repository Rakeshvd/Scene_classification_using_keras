# Scene_classification_using_keras
This is a multi-image classification problem.A simple keras model is used.

Image_classes(preview in github_data folder):

1.buildings.

2.forest.

3.glacier.

4.street.

Each class contains:

Train:~950 images of each class.

Validation:200 images of each class.

Test:10 images of each class.

Notebook : keras_implementation_small.ipynb contains the implementation code

Results are shown in result folder

Error metric: Categorical_crossentropy

Final Accuracy on test images(40): 95%
